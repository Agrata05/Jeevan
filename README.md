## Inspiration 

When we all thought the pandemic was over, we were hit by it with a greater force. Each day the number of cases is increasing and with an increase in the number of people getting infected, itâ€™s getting very hard to find hospitals with beds, ventilators, and the number of vaccines available in hospitals. <br>
Also, there is a huge need for plasma donation in every hospital, and thus an urgent need to make people aware of the process.

## What it does 

We aim to provide a Web App through which people can see the number of hospitals having free beds (with or without ventilators) and are vaccinating people or not. <br>
People can also volunteer themselves for plasma donation and provide space to convert into covid centers through the web App.<br>
On the other hand, Hospitals can register themselves in the app and request plasma donations by the recovered patients and for extra spaces needed for the patients.

## How we built it
The frontend was implemented in <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a>, using <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> for design and layout, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/" target="_blank">Axios</a> to consume the backend.<br>
The backend was developed in <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express.js</a>. Using some middlewares like <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">jwt</a>, to generate tokens, cors to enable the external ports for the frontend. And we keep the information in a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>..
